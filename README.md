# projeto-google-glass-curso-em-video

So guys, here is my first "web" experience that I made watching the course from Curso em Video about html 5. It's really great course where I learned so much about concepts and how to use some tags and css comands I've never thought to use.

If it doenst work on the gitpages, please do download and enjoy!

Note: It's not already finished!!
